# 2x2_neutron_production

This repostitory contains auxiliary scripts for the production of neutron source MC files at NERSC. It is heavily inspired by the structure of [ND_PRODUCTION](https://github.com/DUNE/ND_Production/tree/main), and in fact it borrows many of its scripts. 


# Setup the environment

Before doing anything, you should declare the environment variables

`source setup_production.sh`

# Examples

This repo includes interactive examples for the different stages of the production. There is also the option to pick between AmBe and pulsed neutron source (PNS) events. To check the examples go to: `./prod_examples`
